# Business Sustainability Dashboard App

Goal: Practice creating and accessing data from an API, rendering infographics on an interactive webpage, 

You we approached by consultancy dealing with business sustainability and ethics, who asked you to build a business health-check dashboard. Consultants using the app should be able to load from an API data about business and its employees.

Charts will be used to visualise the data and how it changes when business implements new practices (switches to power-saving lightbulbs, introduces cycle-to-work scheme, etc).

## MVP

Your API will provide information about companies and their business practices.

The web app will visualise this data with graphs.

Produce a report with calculation of total CO2 footprint / expenses /ethical measures.

## Extensions

User can select what improvements they would like to implement to their business in various categories of improvements.

Calculate and visualise projections of savings these improvements caused.

Compare the state of business before and after the changes in practices selected by the user as a part of total savings.
