# Disloyal7 - Clients - Independent Cafes in Edinburgh

Difficulty: Easy-Medium

Goal: Practice creating and accessing data from an API, and using a map on an interactive webpage, 

You we approached by a collective of independent cafes in Edinburgh.

They want you to build a mobile-friendly website with a map which allows people to filter cafes (by things like: outdoors sitting, food, opening hours).


## MVP

Your API will provide information about cafes, their location and details.

The web app will visualise this data with a map.

You can filter cafes by some criteria, and show only some of them on a map.

## Extensions

User can mark some cafes as visited, this could use location of the user to simplify the process. This will require some per-user data persistence (unique link, cookies, or simple login).

Visiting cafes would give user disloyalty points.

Users can write simple reviews/notes.
