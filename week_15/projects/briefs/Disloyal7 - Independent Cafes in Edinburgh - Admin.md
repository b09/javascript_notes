# Disloyal7 - Admins - Independent Cafes in Edinburgh

Difficulty: Hard

Goal: Practice creating and accessing data from an API, and using a map on an interactive webpage.

You we approached by a collective of independent cafes in Edinburgh.

They want you to build an admin suite (a simple CMS) where cafe owners can edit information about their businesses.

## MVP

Your database will contain information about cafes, their location and details.

The web app will enable managing this information. In the MVP do not implement any login structure.

Build externally available API for other apps to access this cafe data.

## Extensions

Create some sort of login to only allow editing cafe info for people who are allowed to edit it. 

Visualise stats about cafes in form of graphs and tables, and how your cafe compares against it (eg. "alert: 80% cafes serve Batch coffee, but you don't", or "Other cafes in your area close later than you on weekends".)
